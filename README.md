#Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to look at trends and key data points from the August bike rentals data set of NYC CitiBike to determine factors that can contribute to the success of a similar business model in Des Moines. I took into consideration Gender, Usertype, and location as the main factors that contribute to success and provide a path for further analysis.

Tools used
- Jupyter notebook and Pandas for data cleaning and  conversions
- Tableau for visualizations

#Summary 

Overall, we can see that bike rental in August of 2019 were very popular with over 2 million rentals in one month. With the majority of the rentals occur during the weekday around normal work and school commute times. This is important because predictable times lead to better bike placement and scheduled maintenance windows that allow to best serve customers. It is also interesting to note that the user demographic is largely subscriber-based loyal customers. There's a substantial amount of one-time users which provides the opportunity for them to convert to subscribers. Also, gender greatly skews toward male users, which provides a better understanding of target user types for marketing and product features in the future.

For future analysis, I would suggest drilling down into the cost of each trip, and one-time user-to-subscriber conversion rate. This would allow another metric that determines the duration and give a point of reference for one-time user numbers and the suspected amount of subscribers that could be gained. especially given that subscribers are the highest income driver. I would display this similarly to the trip duration graph but replace the number of bikes rented with the amount paid. I would also suggest looking into trip beginning and end locations with conversion rates to further see what factors lead to regular use. I would do this by utilizing the map and placing bigger ticks where the highest conversion rates occur.
